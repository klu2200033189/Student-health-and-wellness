                Our goal is to help students reach their <strong>full potential</strong> by optimizing their
                <strong>health and well-being</strong> during their time at the University of Virginia and beyond.

                public health education and leadership, and our nationally renowned research and institutional partnerships.
                Our services are available to all registered students who are charged the mandatory fee with their tuition.
